# repodocs:tool — generated from samirhvbr/repodocs and regenerated in place.
# A copy without this line is the repository's own and is never overwritten.
# release.sh — every version in version.md gets a git tag named after it and a
# published GitHub Release.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: GitHub never infers a version from a commit subject. A repo
# whose history is full of `2.110.161 - …` still shows "No releases published",
# and `git diff 2.110.160..2.110.161` is impossible because neither name exists
# as a ref. The tag is what pins a version number to the exact code it named.
#
# The version is THE FIRST SEMVER IN version.md — not the whole file. Two shapes
# live in this fleet and both must read the same:
#     1.76.108                            (bare, e.g. EOP, SHVIA-WEB, repodocs)
#     # Versão — X\n**Versão atual:** `0.17.1`   (markdown, e.g. the BLUE3-ISP repos)
# That is the rule those repos already document and that config/app.php already
# implements with preg_match('/\d+\.\d+\.\d+/').
#
# Tags carry NO `v` prefix: the tag is byte-for-byte what version.md says.
#
# Idempotent and resumable by construction — anything that already exists is
# skipped, so re-running is free and an interrupted run just continues.
