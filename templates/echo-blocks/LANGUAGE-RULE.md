## Language — English (US) at home, the upstream's when we are guests

**Everything that lives in this repository, or in GitHub's interface around it,
is written in English (US)**: documents, **commit messages**, pull request titles
and bodies, issues, code comments, changelog entries, release notes.

Commit format: `X.Y.Z - short description in English`. The version comes from
`version.md` and is bumped in the same commit. Conventional Commits prefixes
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) and vague one-word messages are forbidden.

**Three carve-outs, and only three.** The first is end-user-facing strings — UI
text, transactional email, product copy: product i18n for a Brazilian audience,
not repository content. The second is the **Blue3 internal repositories**
(`BLUE3-ISP/*`, `samirhvbr/blue3-intranet`, `samirhvbr/blue3-ai-login`,
`samirhvbr/blue3-atendimento`), which are Portuguese throughout — if you are
reading this block inside one of them, this is the wrong block: they carry
`LANGUAGE-RULE-PT`. A repository joins that set by a written decision, never by
argument.

**The third is `.continue/`.** The queue is written in the language its author
thinks in, and becomes English (US) when the work is **produced** and the
document moves to `docs/`. A Portuguese draft in the queue is not a violation to
be fixed: it is unfinished work in the language it is being thought in, and
translating it or moving it out before the thing exists destroys the only place
that thing exists.

History is not rewritten: Portuguese messages already in the log stay as they
are.

**In a repository that is not ours, the upstream's conventions win — the
language and the commit shape both.** Opening a pull request or an issue on a
repository we do not own makes us guests, and a guest writes in the host's
language. Our `X.Y.Z - description` is meaningless there anyway: they have no
`version.md` of ours, and no version for us to bump.

**Check before you write, and the first signal that answers wins:** a written
instruction (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, a pull request or issue template, a contribution
section in the README), then the last ~20 merged pull requests, then the issues,
then the commit log. A written instruction beats observed practice — if they ask
for English and their log is Portuguese, write English. Below that line the
**clear majority** decides, and clear means clear.

**When you cannot tell, write English (US).** A private repository, an empty
history, no network, a refused `gh` call and a genuinely mixed log all land in
the same place — the house rule. Unverifiable is not a licence to guess.

**This is a scope boundary, not a second carve-out.** Nothing in *our*
repositories changes because a foreign one is Portuguese, and code identifiers
are English wherever you are.
